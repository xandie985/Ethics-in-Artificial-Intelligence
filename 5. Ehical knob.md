# Ethical Knob EK (related to Autonomous Vehicle -AV)
EK: a device enabling passengers to ethically customise their AVs, namely, to choose between different settings corresponding to different moral approaches or principles.

Before - Moral machines.  data was collected from users for different cases.   
Now, the EK automatically detects the what to do on the basis of situation. AV will assess the importance of lives of passenger vs padestrians.  

How to perform 2nd action -  percieve the env & compute the assessment of lives inside/outsode
- AI:   
  - Nural netwrorks for right decisions
  - Genetic Algo:
    - a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. The genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions
    - inspired by Charles Darwin
    - Survival of fittest
    - heuristic search in solution space
    - optimization tasks
  - Why GA instead of Backpropagation and gradient descent?

### Simulation
The NN analyse the scenario and gives the output of knob.  
Knob value - used to take action.
