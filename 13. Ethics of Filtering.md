Why Filtering?
- To preventve unlawful/harmfull online behaviour
- prevent abuse 
- facilitate cooperation

## Taxonomy - techniques to be taken for filtering.
Where?
- centralized filtering: whole platform
- decentralized filtering: there is degree of freedom, different policies on different subset of platform 

When?
- Ex ante filtering: automatically removal before the content is posted.
- Ex poste filtering: people can access the post
  * Reactive filtering -  people signal about the item.
  * Proactive filtering - moderation system finds it out before people point out.

How?
- Transparent filtering: kinds of content that is not allowed.
  * Contestable filtering: platform provides the uploader object the filtering, and new decision can be made.
  * Non- Contestable filtering: no remedy is provided to uploader.
- Secret filtering: the operation of removed content is unknown to people. 

Who?
- Manual filtering: humans perform.
- Automated filtering: algo perform.
- Hybrid filtering: both perform.

### Different Media
1. Metadata searching, hashing & fingerprinting - to find duplicate copies of digital documents/data.
2. Blacklisting - unwanted expressions.
3. NLP - addresses the meaning and context. 
4. AI techniques - identify images/text/speech/etc.

1. User upload
2. Automated filtering - not harmful/harmful/uncertain
3. Human moderators in case of *uncertain*
4. Harmful content is removed. User can appeal.

Fails:
* Misclassification of Statues as nude humans.
* Live broadcast of terrorist attack.
* Youtube bannedd Syria attacks.

### Transparency:
Push companies to be more transparents. Bigger platform, bigger risks. 
Santa Clara principles
1. companies should publish no. of post removes and accounts suspended/banned due to violations
2. companies should provide notice to each user whose content is taken down.
3. companies should provide meaningful opportunity for a timely appeal of any conten removal/account suspension.

Issues with Filtering
1. Echo chambers & Filter bubbles - same enviornment/information makes people bent towards a opinion and it is difficult for them to see differnet perspective of issues.
3. Censorships - right level of censorship is key. balanced moderation/no humar right violation.
4. Fake News - with GAN, it is tought to tell fake content from 'natural' content.
