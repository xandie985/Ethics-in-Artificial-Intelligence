# Automomy
- ability to parform an action in real world without any external control/supervision.
- ability to percieve and interpret enviornment and make suitable adjustments

If too high - no artificial entity is Autonomous
If too low - all algorithms are Autonomous

## Autonomous as scalable capacity - 3 dimensions
### *1. Indpendence:* 
accomplishing task without external interventions.
- socio technial system: integration of human & technology: airplane, civil aviation etc.
-  Independence in context of systems - autopilot, collision avoidance systems etc.

### *2. Cognitive Skills* 
- high level cognition. The system should use its own abilities for following
- Aquisition and classification of input data. i/p data, noise reduction, filtering etc
- Info analysis and further colclusion extraction. compute trajaectories, dealing with bad weather, approaching objects etc.
- Action selection: create Plan of Action, flight routtes, overriding informamtions, fly or engage, etc
- Implementation & monitoring.
Fighter plane TARANIS uses all above steps. 

Humans in loop - autonomy of device increases 
- increase indepencdence of device
- increased interaction b/w human and machine
- technological device execute more cognitive tasks/functions. 

Cognitive delegation 
- the delegator chooses the execution of functions by the system.(flying aircraft/ engaging target)
- delegator doesn't know and cant pre-select the choices. (which path to take/whom to kill)

### *3. Cognitive behavioural architecture*
- Adaptiveness: system cana adapt to the env and change its internal state based upon recieving inputs. It has capacity to adapt and still focused on the main target. 
- Teleology:
a. goals - objective
b. belief - enviornment information.
c. plan - how to reach goal in given env.
d. intention - wrt to the plans, executing on goals by systems.

Multilayer Autonomy:
- interaction of lower level non-autonomous/autonous elements.

#### Autonomy in weapon systems (AWS)
Multiple countries agree/disagree to use AWS
US 2012 - target selection [assistance from human needed]
AW - once activated they decide the targets on its own.
Semi AW - need human operator for engaging

#### 2 steps in targeting process:
1. Weapon is sent in particular area, target zone. 
2. Within that area targets are chosen, kill zone.

Semi-autonomous weapons are autonomous
1. Humans give discription to engage upon.
2. Weapons detect and matches the discription and shoot.

#### Kind of responsibility
Functional responsibilty - defect in functionality
Blameworthiness - moral obligations in case of harm

### *Principles of Deployment of AW.*
Necessary -When another party harms us. we have to take actions.
Distinction - bombarding should not effect civilian lives/properties
Proportionality - loss of civilian lives/property should be proportional to military goal pursued.

AW wont do ill-treatment to the prisnor of wars, which is common in armed forces.
AW may not be able to distinguish armed forces with civilians.
Soldiers lives are more important.
HUMAN SHOULD HAVE THE FINAL DECISION WHEN MAKING ENGAGING DECISIONS.

#### Liability gap
It is impossible to give moral responsiblity when harm is caused.We see miliary personel are never charged for their actions, while civilians have to face charges and explainations.
