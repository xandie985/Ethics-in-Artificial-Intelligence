### AV
Working on basis of:
1. Lidars & Radar - for object avoidance.
2. GPS antennas - for location on map.
3. Camera - machine vision.

#### Degree of Automation
Six levels of automation. 
In market we have mostly level 1 and few upto level 2.
L0 - no automation.
L1 to L4 - driver has some control over vehicle.
L5 - Fully automated.

Human Supported Driving [L0-L2]
Automated Driving [L3-L5]

L1-L2: integration on automated features in vehicle.
L3: In very specific cases, driver's attention is needed.
L4: Operation Designed Domain - based on road condition/weather etc. Transitioning between these condition is challenging and control is given back to the driver.
L5: No driver is there. Moral & Ethical concerns.

Autonomy and freedom - driving is mudane task and time can be spent on something more important.

everyone, blind, physically challenged etc. 

How?
decision should be moral, so people should be involved. The mixture of both parties ensure trust and growth of AV.
The decision making process/Regulations should be very clear & transparent for public.
*Soft Law*: guidelines and recommendations are given to stakeholders to align the values that are important.

Ethics of AV
- documentation for EV released in 2020. 
- Based on 8 principles : 20 recommendations for stakeholder/users to follow. 

#### Unavoidable Collisions:
When the collision cannot be avoided. Decision - whom to hurt? Pedestrian or people in cars?
*Accident- algo* deals with such situations.
*This is a new ethics, which is not cared in case of regular driving.*

#### Privacy and Security issues?
Privacy involved in AV driving. 
Consent should be taken for gathering data - for using camera/equipments. 
What about other road users?

#### Cybersecurity
The sensors can be tampered. 
Hacking AV.
Who is responsibile for such cases?

Responsibility:
Who is responsible? Users/Systems? Shared?
Control and Responsibilties are linked. 

#### Sustainability
3 elements.
