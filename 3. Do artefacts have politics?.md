### Artifacts (AA): Physical objects created by humans that is not naturally present.

#### Robert Moses' overpass
Robert Moses ordered engineers to build the Southern State Parkway’s bridges extra-low, to prevent poor people in buses from using the highway. The truth? It’s a little more complex.

#### Politics behind Artifacts
social class bias  
racial prejuidice  
poor people in bus cannot access the beach. 

####  Technological Mediation: when technologies fulfil their actions, they also help shape actions and perception of users
* they help us to see and hear and feel things, but also to understand the world in new ways because of the new ways to access the world that they open up for us.
* Technological Artifacts are morally and politically charged
- Tech. mediation
- The moroalization of technologies
ULTRASOUND: means to mediate relation between fetus and parents. Not just make featour visible from womb.  
It plays mediate role - now it can cause abotrtion/discourage abortions in case of medical complexities etc.

Passive to active responsibilities  
AI technologies
  - experimental tech.
  - invisibility factor

Invisible factor.
focuses on the feature of computers that much of their operations are invisible. So, it can be biased to some peeople, intentinally/unintentionally. Same way as Moses did.   

Morality is not only human affair but "matter of things" as well. 
The interaction between human and AA should be fair.

#### Ethics are matter of things
AA bear morality - they always take decision for people. eg. speed bump etc.

### Moralizing technologies
buying tickets before entering bus.   
along with moral humans, even the enviornment can be moralized.   

A Paradigm shift: 
passive responsibilty:  backward looking, after the event occured.
active responsibility: responsibity take from the beginning of design of artifacts, preventing -ve effects of tech but also realizing the +ve effects. 

#### Active Responsibility and AI
- There can be some uncertianity while introducing these technologies in society. 

AI and Invisibilty factors:
- the operations are invisible. 
- unaware of processing.

#### Types of Invisibilty

#### Moralizing technologies
* joint effort between humans and technological AA

#### taking mediation into ethics
- Alcohol lock cars: moralizing of technology.
- Shower heads for saving water"

#### Critizing moral characters
- explicitly bevaviour steering technologies, are critizised. 
  - human looses freedom
  - dignity issues 
  - risk of immorality

#### democratic way to moralize technology
- technologies are different than laws.
- Law - result of democratic procss.
- Tech - decision made by small grp of people. (invisibilty factor involved)

#### designing mediations
- designer cannot simply design any form to an artifact. (the designs have impact on users)
- designers need to anticipate future mediating roles of technologies they are designing.
