## Trustworthy AI
* Lawful: follows law and regulations
* Ethical: follows principal and values
* Robust: wrt social and technical POV.

## Ethical Principles
fundamental ethical principles -> Bioethics (medical domain)

1. Respect for human autonomy
  - AI should not subrdinate, coerce, decieve, manipulate people/group of people without any proper justification. eg.face recog to identify people in open
  - AI should be designed to augmnet, compliment and empower human cognitive/social and cultural skills. eg. reliance on GPS
  - the interaction between humans & AI systems should follow human-centric design principle with meaningful opportunity for human choice. eg. Uber drivers are controlled by systems - reward & punishment based on behaviour of people.
  - AI should work alongside humans for cretion of usefull work.

2. harm prevention
  - AI should not kill/harm humans.
  - AI should avoid accidents and mishaps. 

3. Fairness
  - Substantive dimension: equal & fair distrubution/promoting equal opportunities for goods, technology, education/ should not decieve humans or imare the freedom of choice (eg. selling tickets by saying -'buy the last ticket, one left!')/ balance the competing interests and objectives
  - Procedural dimension: ability to contest and seek effective redress against decision made by AI/ We should choose who is acountable for a decision/

4. Explicability
  - important decisions concerning humans as we need to ensure contestibility (contestibility - fair & transparent process/ capabilites and purpose should be openly discussed/ explaination to people effected) . 
  - model should provide proper decision making exaplaintion to the users/subject, to ensure fairness. 
  - *It is not possible to expain model's reasoning behind decision making all the time. This impossibility should be also explained.* 

There is tension between principles
* 2. Harm prevention & 1. Autonomy
* 4. Explicability and performace 

## Requirement of TAI (Trustworthy AI)
1. Human Agency and oversight - support human autonomy and decision making - when AI system is introduced, its impact on society (technical robustness/resilience to attack and security/reliability and reproducibilty/fundamental rights/human agency/human oversight (humans are 'On the loop'/'In the loop')/accuracy/fallback plan and saffety) should be studied.
2. Technical robustness and safetly - AI sys should be developed so they behave reliably + minimize unintentional harm
3. Privacy & data governance - prevention of harm(follow privacy norm & data protection)/Quality & integrity of data (no errors, bias)/access to data
4. Transparency: tracebility (dataset & models should be documented)/exaplainbility/communication (tell humans when they interact with AI) 
5. Diversity & non discrimination and fairness: avoid unfair bais/accessibility & universal design/ stakeholder participation/ diversity and inclusive design teams
6. Societal & env well being: sustainable & env friendly/ social impact/ society & democracy
7. Accountability: Auditability/ Minimisation & reporting of -ve impacts/tradeoff/redress.

## Ethical Fundamental rights
### Resoect for human dignity:
1. AI should be treated with importance. Not as a tool to extract money/fulfil agenda.
2. Freedom of individual: freedom to conduct business/art/science/expresison/private life and privacy etc.

### Respect for democracy, justice and rule of law:
1. democratic voting system - -AI should not influence peoples opinion to choose/vote. 
2 process and equality before law. use of AI in judicial system - predicting recedivism.

### Equality, non discriminatity and solidarity
1. Based on credit score/ethic AI cannot exclude the rights of people.

### Other citizens rights
1. right to vote/good administration/access to public doc.
