# GDPR:
### Personal Data (PD)
Informaiton that has direct relation to a person's identity. These information can be used to track back to an individual. 
•	Anonymisation – removing data so person cannot be retraced
•	Pseudonymisation – separate the user ID data and keep it apart | only few people can access that data. Inferred data can be kept public.

AI and PD – AI can infer more information from anonymised data, can cause re-identification of person.

---
Re-identification
By AI and stastical correlation, connecting people with nonidentifiable data. 
2016 - reidentified politicials in anonymised data of 3 million citizens. 
Australia - reidentified all people based on taxi, bike, subway, phone usage data and credit card datasets. 

-
Solution of above problems using AI and GDPR
1. find ways so reidentification is not possible.
2. implementing more security for data release

-
Inferred personal Data
extracting new data from different sources. 
By face -> sex
online activity -> personality

---
Profiling
automated processing of personal data. 
predicting
•	performance at work
•	economic situation
•	health
•	behaviour
•	interest etc.
decision made on profiling may be biased.
When AI learns the response of the person to a stimuli -> it can start manipulating him/her. Unethical process.

### Legal status of Inferred data
1. Model doesnt contains personal data after learning is finished.
2. It combines possible input & likelihood to all individuals with similiar characterstics.
3. When model is applied to new individual the personal data and outcome of the model for that person is personal data.

The inferred data based on our behaviour is also personal data. People have right to access the data. Article 29.

Right to rectification. 
people can ask for rectification if the inferred data is not appropriate. He/she can ask for changes.
But point is - where to make changes? collected data or inferred data.

Acceptability -i/p data should be acceptable and not based of prohibited features - sex/rate/color
Relevance - inferred data should be reelevant to the decision. - credit card based on race/color
Reliability - i/p data and methods used to process should be reliable.

Consent
clear affirmative action to process personal data related to a person.
Issues:
	cookie consent 
	- by default it is set to yes
	- the people dont know have knowledge about it accept it
	- at time of consent - person doesnt know about future use.

Consent GDRP rules:
1. Specificity 
	- consent has to be precific. 
	- should indicate each purpose.
	- people should know what the data will be used for in case of scientific studies
2. Granularity
	- for each activity seperate consent
3. Freedom
	- consent is not legal justification in case personal data is used when there is imbalance between data subject and controller.
	- service provider should not ask for consent irrelevant to the  service provided.
	
AI and Data Protection principles
Transparency
	- users of system should know how system will process their data.
Fairness
	- users should not be tricked into unknown/unintended purposes. 
	- Dark Pattern: forced, bait, hidden cost and manipulated buying behaviour
Purpose Limitation
	- collected data should be collected for purpose that is legitimate &  specified explicitly.
