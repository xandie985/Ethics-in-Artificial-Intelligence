### Impartiality?
golder rule: treat others as you wish to be treated.  
Issue?  
If I want to beat someone, I have to be ready to get beaten. There are mismatch between the preferences. HUmans can be honest with robots and same robots has to be with humans?

Basic of deontology:
- Religion
- Idea of impartiality is at the basis of deontology. 
 
## Kantial Ethics
Kntian maxim:  We should do our duty for no other reason than because it’s the right thing to do.  
The actions have reasoning, and people have to follow.  
Maxim: principle of action, connects reason and action.   

4 keys elements:  
(i) capacity to understand and reason;  
(ii) capacity to set and be subject to universal moral rules;   
(iii) practical reasoning; and  
(iv) self-reflective and deliberative capacity.  

**Universalisation test**

### immanuel kant vs benjamin constant
Is it okay to tell a murderer the location of its prey?  
Kantian can refuse to answer as well. *Do not say anything!*  
But when forced to speak?  
SHould AI system tell lie??  
For Kant - rationality is applicable. included requirement of universalizability - *practical rationality* (some thing that has to be universalized, so cheating is not practically rational).  
Different for *instrumental rationality* (act in a way to max. probability of achiving a goal)  

### Hypothetical imerative
Hypothetical imperatives tell us how to act in order to achieve a specific goal and the commandment of reason applies only conditionally, e.g. "I must study to get a degree."  

### *Categorical imperatives:*
it is a way of evaluating motivations for action.  
It is best known in its original formulation: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."  

2 condition:
1. make false promise that suits you?
2. refuse to help who are in need when it suits you?

Observations
1. is not fine. 
2. debatable. But for Kant, this maxim doesnt pass the test provided by categorical imperative. as nobody will help you if you would not accept this kind of state of affairs.  

#### The good will
- morality is interrelated with intention of good will. 
- necessity to comply with categorical imperative. 

#### Categorical Imperative: Principle of humanity

#### Dignity: something that doesnt have any price, above price. 
This dignity creates an ethical ‘line in the sand’ that prevents us from acting in certain ways either toward other people or toward ourselves (because we have dignity as well). Most importantly, Kant argues that we may never treat a person merely as a means to an end (never just as a resource or instrument).  
Why dignity to humans?
- aware
- can reason
- choose what to do and what to follow
*kingdom of ends - everything has a price or has dignity.  

#### AI using people only as means
- Autonomous weapons
- Decieving ads

### moralilty{M} as aspect of rationality(R)
For Kant, if we follow R, we have to be M.
What about R criminal? - Is it R to pursue my wellbeing at expense of others? getting profit at harm of others?   
R - based on reason and logic
M - a particular system of values and principles of conduct.
Kant would ssay - criminal would be bad and not fully ratoinal in this case. 

### Rational and Consistent

### Issues with kantian 
- Universalization of principle always provide acceptable outocmes? No. 
- Lying/Robbing/celibacy/genocide?
-  Kantian ethics is doomed to be either empty and formalistic or rigidly uniform in its prescriptions (the complaints cannot both be true)  

## Alan Gewirth
- every agent must act in accordance with his or her own and all other agents' generic rights.
- "I have right to pursue my goal if I want something, because others also have this right"

*Kantian robots
Yes: consistent and impartial  
No: may act on bad maxim that are too rigid.

Deontological and anti-consequentialist as it is based on adherance to rules or duties rather than outcomes.  

## Friedrich Nietzsche
- everything is in flux, and there is no such thing as fixed being. Matter is always moving and changing, as are ideas, knowledge, truth, and everything else. The will to power is the fundamental engine of this change.  
- anti kantian approach
- one has duties towards one's equal. follow the heart/
- Superior human does not find/disover values, they determines values.

## John Rawls: A theory of justice
His theory of justice as fairness describes a society of free citizens holding equal basic rights and cooperating within an egalitarian economic system  

### 1st principle
Each person has the same and indefeasible [permanent] claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme of liberties for all

### 2nd principle
Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions:
- first, they are to be attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity; and
- second, they are to be to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society (the Difference Principle).

**Veil of Ignorance**  way of working out the basic institutions and structures of a just society. 
- working out what justice requires demands that we think as if we are building society from the ground up, in a way that everyone who is reasonable can accept

*Rawls approach is consistent in society where freedom of speech and asspciation is strongly limited by usage of AI?
No, because its against 1st principle, which is more important that 2nd one.

## Jeurgan Habermas
social order ultimately depends on the capacity of actors to recognize the intersubjective validity of the different claims on which social cooperation depends.

## Virtue Ethics
It defines good actions as ones that display embody virtuous character traits, like courage, loyalty, or wisdom. A virtue itself is a disposition to act, think and feel in certain ways.  
Ethics is a complex matter: there are many virtue, right act is mix of virtues.  
Ethics cnnot be learned through set of rules. It requires practical wisdom. 

Is it okay to teach AI by ex? or rule based system?
