#### Why AI should not be reduced to a mere technology?
The world is a augmented and mixed reality -> real + web (physical + vvirtual)  
Hybrid society -> Human intelligence + artificial intelligence  
AI is building new kind of society -*anthropological revolution*   

1. For science oriented AI   
pleasure of research: get knowledge/discover ideas etc.  
AI provides a way to explain mind, intelligence, action, emotion, knowledge etc.   
*Using AI is not just applying concepts and theories but contribute to these sciences and improve them.*   
In future our cognitive abilities will grow beyond, and we can change.    

Why we need AI models?   
- modelling explaining human & natual intelligence   
- emulating them   
- creating new intelligence and theory   

# AI revolution empowerment:
The agents    
- are autonomous
- are social
- follow norms
- adopt to our goals
- not just following order, but doing more than what we ask for.

Issues with these agents
- Are we missing the control?

Issue with mass media:
- privacy
- security over web
- fake news
- hacking
- anthropomorphism - (non human with human capabilities)
- war & AI soldiers

## Is ML & AI only for business and earning money

### Engineering Moral Agents   
Imbuing robots and Autonomous systems with [ethical norms and values] is urgent challenge.    
Not just surveillance but embed value and control in the systems.   

who decides the working of machine intelligence?   
- Scientists/ML/Students -> can be experts but cannot improve the overall thinking/functional capability of future robots   
- We need politicials/women empowerment/poor counties/ different people from different backgrnds for overall improvements.   

Society 
- differnce between interest and goals between different people. 
- dominant vs poor countries.

### AI should focus on
- democracy
- good market: reduced decption/manipulation
- social planning & decisions, political fairness
- transparency & control, participartion

## Hidden interest and awareness:
- reasoning behings decisions made by AI
- moral and polical POV for decisions
- scientists should be fair to see every aspects equally.
- democracy is not a formal and misinformed voting ritual.

AI should help in RATIONAL DECISION MAKING 
- remove irratinal thinking/biases.
- we consumers are constatly pushed by the system and people are not aware.
- the bots/AI should provide reason/rationale behind their actions/decision/discussion.

### Tutelary Role: 
**when someone thinks about us and help us, but also understand:
- common interests that is good from societal POVs as well
- hidden conflict of interests
- common for public good and their relevance and respect env/health/water/energy

model - suggest us thing - kind of push - marketing - are they doing it for my interest/someone else?   
eg. recommendation sys   

## Mouth of truth algo   
what is truth? how the model will justify?      
The model will search and confirm with the sources. But are the sources true?   
How can we be sure the model uses the sources that are reliable/credible. As informaiton can have many aspects.    

## Presence in our mixed reality and society   
Autonomous and provative intelligent entities will become present and have roles in the hybrid society.    
Mixed reality -> mixed body and mind?   
mental prosthesis?   

## Disagreement Technologies   
### A.    
strong ideology and rhetoric about society as coorperation, collaboration, common intent, collective advantages.   
How to come to a common conclusion/sort out arguments etc.?   

Population - different class/gender/culture - values and interest differ.   
so, when people say "we" they refer to their own people. So, there is no common interest in many cases.    
   
Democracy is not a responce to conflicts or a way to moderate them.    
It encourages conflicts   
It tries to solve them         
and as a whole - it tries to take decisions to provide extra benefits to minority classes.   

### Critical thinking    
Using internet to organize "movements" is fine but not so good without promoting critical consciousness.   
We think internet is free and open. No one own's it.    
But in reality we are being tracked. Our activity and information is used for economic interest/influence & manipulation.    
   
### Anti manipulation      
There should be AI techniques that can reason and help us to not get manipulated by the any kind of system.   
they should make him/her consious about the decisions.    



#### Why AI should care about economic, political and social platforms  for ethical purpose.
