# Modelling Norms (MN)
* here we try to representation of legan norms in form of rules.  
* law can be made represented & computable - AI can help.
* 2 main steps in development of computable law
  1.  how to modela nd formalize law with logic. 
      logic programming and knowledge representation.
  2.  Once computable model of law is created, it can be used as input in the process of moving knowledge from knowledge encoded in system to provide answers. 

### Knowldge represtation KR
- application of logic and ontology to taks of constructing computable model.
- everything should be made computable
- presented /stored such a way model can process info.
- We use **declarative programming** for such cases - Prolog, ruleLM
  - facts and relations are defined.
  - programs finds and related the given statement. 

#### Rule based systems:

#### Legal applications:
- Now a days, rule based systems are used in legal domain for legal analysis & automated legal assessment.

For symbolic application why we chose law?
- we can see laws as prepositions, if-then relation.
- these are conditional statements - connects abstract, facts and legal aspects. 

Presentaiton of legal norm:
Premises contains
- rule itself (conditions with variables), 
- practical fact where we want to apply the rule (filling variables in rule)

### Legal KR: issues and challenges
- -Ambiguity: 
- Vagueness: issue with meaning and connection of words used in law.
- Rigidity: fixed meaning, there are no flexibilty, there are need to stretch laws to cover few situations not covered in law.
- How to Represent deontic positions: encoding obligation, permissions or facts that are prohibited. 
- how to enable temporal reasoning: problem of time, as time plays important role in cases. 
- how to deal with conflict legal rules

- how to manage reification: conflict betweeen rules and problem of temportal reasoning.
- how to maintain isomorphsm between source text and representation: risk of information to be misinterpretted due to improper representaiton. So, we should maintain logic structure & introdue modification in legal domain & laws regularly. 
- Other issues: the law is not so practical/less occurance, so it wont be upadated and difficult to represent. 


### Example of logical representatoin of a norm

### Ex of ambiguity

### Ex of vagueness
- present in legal and moral resoning as well. 
- criminal laws which do not state explicitly and definitely what conduct is punishable are void for vagueness. A statute is also void for vagueness if a legislature's delegation of authority to judges and/or administrators is so extensive that it would lead to arbitrary prosecutions.

### Interlex
InterLex is an EU funded project that aims at developing an online platform to provide information, decision support and training on private international law. It addresses the identification of the legal system having jurisdiction and of the national law to be applied to a specific case as well as the retrieval of relevant legal materials.
