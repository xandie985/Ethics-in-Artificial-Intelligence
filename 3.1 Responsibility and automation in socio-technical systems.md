## Responsibilty (R)
Active sense: Person performs tasks associated to his role & behaves in responsible way.
Passive sense: moral and legal responsibility. 

### Sense of responsibility
* Task R: assigned task shall be executed.
* Aretaic R: if person devotes required care to the responsible task. 
* Causal R: An entity/event X, is causally responsible for harmful event H, if X us caused by H. Hurricane -> delay in flight takeoff etc. 
* Accountability R: agent X, is accountable for harmful event H, if given X's position X may be requested to explain the happening of H, and may be possibly be subject to moral-socio-legal consequences related to H.
* Blameworthy R: X is blameworthy of damage *h*, when X caused H. & X's action causing H represent a fault/violation.
* Capacity R: Agent X is capacity responsible/capable if x satisfies mental condition with are required for liability. 
* Liability R: X is liable/responsible for harmful event H, if given X's connection to H, X is to be subject to the sanction (punishment) connected to H.

### Basic structure
Complex system consist of:

ex:  
* Air Traffic COntrol
* Public admin
* healthcare
A system with good responsibility - increases efficiency and reduces cost.  

#### Future of ATM: Air Traffic Management  
SESAR - after 30 years new gen of ATM system will be dev*highly automated/make choice/engage in action with some level of human supervision or even without/
* The Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) 
* set up in 2004 to modernise Europeâ€™s ATM system
* **goal of SESAR** 
  - contribute to the SES High-Level Goals of tripling capacity, 
  - halving costs per flight by 50 %, reducing
  - emissions by 10 % and improving safety by a factor of 10.

### Implications of Automation(AM)
* tasks will be handled by technology instead of operators. not all, but few/
* humans will be controller and supervisor
* Hybrid agency - sysmbiosis - joint cognitive systems
* Machine intelligence & autonomy
* *Challenge of complexity - "many hands". There are so many people/technologies involved, who will be liable/responsible

### AM: not all or nothing
* Not just substitution of humans operators but support to human capabilites in performing tasks.
* Some degree of cooperation needed.

#### Level of Automation:

Use of video camera: A2, systems supports human in acquring information. *It is upon human to choose which information is relevant*.  
Ativation of speed vectors by controllers: B2, based on users request -> the system hepl human in comparinf, ,combingna nd analysing diff ingfo items regarding the status of process being followed.  
Sequnce of landing aircraft: C2, system proposed 1 or more decision alternatives to human. human has freedom of choice.
Autopilot: D4, system automatically performs seq. of actions after activation by humans. Human can intervene at any time. 

ARGOS: technology dev by gov in future to replace the trafic controlled. Different than Autopilot because it will only ask for human attention only when needed, its works in opposite as in Autopilot. 

#### SAFELAND project
The project aims at supporting flight and landing of aircraft operated by a single pilot, in case of partial or total incapacitation of the pilot. SAFELAND will focus on the ground side and in particular on the role Air Traffic Management (ATM) could have in managing the transition from a single pilot operated flight to a status with reduced or absent contribution of the onboard pilot.

### Level of AM and responsibilty

50-50 responsibilty between human & mahcines?  
No, because in situation - systems are more complex and cmplicated. So many task are to be carried out by tech & humans. There can be a risk of task responsibilty - both human & tech might execute it.   
Increasing level of AM - increases responsibilty of tech provider & decrease the responsibilty of human operator.
* Humans are moral crumple zones - so systems can become vunerable. 
- *Near accident/ Near Failure*- in case of failure luckily there is no accident. So, people dont take responsibility and may not report it. So, people should be given incentive to report the errors.
- People should be confident over system for granted, that even in case of human failure the system will protect it. 

### Fragmantion of task - 
may result in complexity of procedures. Who will do which task? so there is no miss.

HMI : Human Machine Interaction  
For etchial and leegal POV, we have to ensure the tech is under human control - take care of design of HMI.

### Open issue: Decision making authority
Effective decision making authority?
- joint cognitive sys?
- model described by law/regulation/procedure?

What about decision taken with assistance with AI?
- eg. medical diagnosis
- eg. frontext border control - decides within 12 sec.
- Since AI prediction should be clear and reasonable. Then only, humans can consider it for decision making process.
