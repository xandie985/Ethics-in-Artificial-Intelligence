+ve morality : moral accepted in the society.  
Bad morality: Considering women lesser than men.  
Morality can be motivated by belief that an action is right, regardless of how it affets our interest.

Critical Morality; correct, rational, in favour of social interest.

### Ethics vs metaEthics
* MetaE: based on moral judgement, involves feelings, scope, nature of act etc. Two approaches
  - cognitivist: possible to know what should we do and shouldnt.
  - non-cognivitist - based on feeling
  - realistic and non-realist approach -there are facts in world to prove ethical statements true.

### Consequentialism (C)
  - common moral approach
  - judge actions by considering their outcomes.
  - produces highest utility.

#### Utilitarianism (U)
  - key to approach consequentialism
  - Utility: Happiness/satisfactoin of interest
  - U is not egoism
  - forecast the impact of choice on product for people's well being.
  - choose actions that provides better payoff.
  - everyone's utility is taken into account

Advantage of U
* conceptually simple
* Egalitarian: everybody's utility is considered equally
* Fits with basic intution: make people happy
* Workable in most cases

Version of U:
1. Act U: do action that  maximise utility. We perform action here. 
  - issues with Act U: what happens when we dont have enough informatoin to find the outcome of action, shall we take probability of utility?
  - Is it too demanding: shall we give away all to poor and I survive on minimum?
  - Is it okay to harm people for greater benefits of other? YES, Utilitaristic people will. 
  - Utilitarian would say: *In case in which U fails are not realistic* & *No difference between moral beliefs and U* 
2. Rule U: Follow rule consistent application of maximising utility. We think and follow the rule. More difficult than Act U, because we have keep in mind all possible outcomes. 
  - Is it morally right just because it is omtimific social rule. 
  - Okay to tell truth. not to steal. as it produces max utility.
  - Shoudl we be honest if most people are dishonest?
  - will u follow those rules, which are not followed by most of people?  
  - **Distribution:** does it matter how good and bad outcomes are distributed?  
    - is it okay to make decision on the loss of others?  
  - U vs wealth Maximisation: 
    - U favours equal wealth distribution. 
    - impact of wealth redistribution has to be reconsidered. 

#### TROLLY PROBLEM:
U will push the lever to kill 1 person. U would push the fat man to save other people.  
D (Deontologist) wont push the lever. Takes no responsibility of killing as it was destined to happen.  

Double affect : pushing lever - causes death and saves people, two sides of event. intend of action/side effect of action.  
U can be problematic, cannot fit common sense during reasoning.  

Is AI U?
AI should have vast knowledge to compute all possiblities and maximise happiness of people.

*A:*
- U will kill the single person to save other. 
- wont care about red/green light. 

*B:*
- either save yourself/save pedestrian
- U might kill other to save him/herself.
- If we go straight - its not illegal to save myself. 

#### SURGEON CASE
- killing 1 healthy person to save other 5 medically ill people?
- U would say its not realistic. 
- Rule U: sacrifice the young healthy man.

### Deontology (D)
- Rights are duties come first. 
- C hold choices - act/intentions to be morally assessed solely by the states of affairs they bring about.
- D hold certain actions as good/bad regardless of their consequences.
